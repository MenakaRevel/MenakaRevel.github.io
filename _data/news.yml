  description: "*We investigated the impact of climate change and ENSO on flood occurrence in the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna basin, using a large ensemble climate simulation database and a catchment-based macro-scale floodplain model, finding that climate change increases the occurrence probability of 10-year return period maximum discharge in the pre-monsoon and post-monsoon seasons.* [Access the full text here](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2025.133207)."
