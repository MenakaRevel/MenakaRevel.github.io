## [Preparing Empirical Local Patches for Data Assimilation](../prod_emplp/)
Empirical local patches identify relevant areas of a river system for specific locations based on water level behavior. Instead of assuming all nearby points influence each other equally, this method analyzes actual patterns in simulated water surface elevation to pinpoint strong relationships. By eliminating trends and seasonal variations, it focuses on meaningful spatial connections to create custom patches. These patches can change in size depending on the riverâ€™s characteristics; for example, the Amazon has a broader influence than a smaller stream. This approach enhances the accuracy of river models and satellite data for predicting water levels. Building on Revel et al. (2018), this method better reflects the actual structure of river networks, moving beyond simplistic distance assumptions. In summary, empirical local patches strengthen the alignment of models with real river behavior, improving the precision of hydrologic analysis.
