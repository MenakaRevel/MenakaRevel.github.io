# Welcome!
I pursued the intersection of data assimilation, remote sensing, and hydrological modeling during my training as an environmental modeler and hydrologist. By incorporating satellite measurements like altimetry and SWOT into routing models like [CaMa-Flood]("https://hydro.iis.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~yamadai/cama-flood/"), and [Raven]("https://raven.uwaterloo.ca/"), my study aims to improve the realism and forecasting ability of large-scale hydrological models.

Currently, I am working as a postdoctoral fellow in the [Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, University of Waterloo]("https://uwaterloo.ca/civil-environmental-engineering/"), where I contribute to the [Hydrology Group]("https://uwaterloo.ca/scholar/btolson/people-0").

Please visit the Hydrology group at the University of Waterloo [here]("https://uwaterloo.ca/scholar/btolson/people-0").

Previously, I served as a Project Researcher in the [Global Hydrodynamics Lab]("https://global-hydrodynamics.github.io/") in [Institute of Industrial Science]("https://www.iis.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/"), [The University of Tokyo]("https://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/") from Oct 2019 to Aug 2023. There, I collaborated on projects that explored freshwater dynamics on a global scale using modeling, remote sensing, and model-data integration.

Please visit Global Hydrodynamics Lab at the University of Tokyo [here]("https://global-hydrodynamics.github.io/").

My dedication to open science and data accessibility has been a recurring theme in my work. Through user-centered, web-based platforms, I actively create tools and procedures that facilitate the exchange of data, model configurations, and research outcomes. The goal of my work is to close the gap between large end-user groups and sophisticated hydrological systems. Please visit my [GitHub page]("https://github.com/menaka-revel").

## Research Interests
My primary research interests are hydrological modeling and integrating remote sensing data into models. Currently, I am modelling Canadian lake-dominated watersheds and calibrating the models using remote sensing data such as SWOT. Previously, I have been working on data assimilation into hydrodynamic modeling using satellite altimetry data. I am also involved in developing [CaMa-Flood]("https://github.com/global-hydrodynamics/CaMa-Flood_v4") hydrodynamic model for a better representation of global fresh water.
