# Welcome!

I am currently working as a Project Researcher in [Global Hydrodynamics Lab]("https://global-hydrodynamics.github.io/") in [Institute of Industrial Science]("https://www.iis.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/"), [The University of Tokyo]("https://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/"). In Global Hydrodynamics Lab, we are working on fresh water dynamics in global scale using modelling, remote sensing, and model data integration. 
Please visit Global Hydrodynamics Lab [here]("https://global-hydrodynamics.github.io/").

## Research Intrests
My major research intersts are in modelling water in global scale. Recenlty I have been working on data assimilation into hydrodynamic modeling using satellite altimetry data. I am also invloved on developing [CaMa-Flood]("https://github.com/global-hydrodynamics/CaMa-Flood_v4") hydrodynamic model for better representation of global fresh water.
